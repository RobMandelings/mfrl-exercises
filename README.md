This repository contains scripts and templates for programming exercises
assigned during the Mathematical Foundations of RL course at UAntwerp.

We will be making use of 
[OpenAI's gym environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control).

# Installation
We strongly recommend that you carry out the following steps using a virtual
environment.

## Virtual environments
For Python 3, you can enter some directory and create a virtual environment
within it executing `python3 -m venv virtualenvironment`. Then, you can
activate your virtual environment by sourcing the activate script in its bin
directory.

## Dependencies
To install everything needed, you can now run:
```
pip install gym
```
Alternatively, there is a requirements.txt file in this repository you can
use by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
